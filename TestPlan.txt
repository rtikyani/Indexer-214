For the indexer, I used some of my own .txt files which were simple sentences. I included symbols/non-alphanumerical characters to test for correctness. In terms of scalability- the largest file I used was an essay I wrote for my other class. It was able to handle the large size but the one problem I had was to get it to be in alphabetical order after being sorted. This is the only issue I had; everything else seems to work fine.
